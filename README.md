# GuessTheFlag

This iOS app is a game that tests your flags knowledge. Basically, it gives you one country and asks you to press the right flag among the 3 flags displayed. As soon as you click, an alert pops up and displays your score and whether you guessed right or wrong. The score is also always shown at the top right corner and updates dynamically. You can also restart the game whenever you want. This will reset your score to 0.
